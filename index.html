            <h2 class="mb-5">Interests</h2>
            <p>Within the field of mathematics, I have stronger interests particularly in topology and measure
                theory. Much of my current research is dedicated to the intersection of these two subjects,
                fascinating granted they are on opposite sides of the domain of mathematics. I am currently the
                primary author of an undergraduate-level textbook covering many of the contemporary discoveries with fractal
                geometries and the existing means of measuring them. </p>
            <p>Apart from being a mathematician, I love spending my time writing and creating music. I am a
                violinist and pianist, although most of my focus goes towards music composition, especially for small
                ensembles. Yet I still perform as a concert violinist for various symphonies on the easy coast, and I am
                currently preparing for a performance of Vieuxtemps' 4th Violin Concerto.
                </p>
            <p>Otherwise, I am a quite avid runner; I enjoy competing in cross-country and track for my
                school, primarily running 8K races for cross country, and for track, the 5000m and 10000m. During the
                winter months, I like going on skiing trips, but when I am in the mood for the more intense slopes, I
                am forced to travel to Colorado. As me and my friends say...
                "nothing but bunny slopes here!"</p>
            <p class="mb-0">When my brain and body are too fatigued to engage in my energy-taxing hobbies, I enjoy
                binge-watching horror movies at home with friends and/or loved ones. However, it takes a lot to
                exhaust me to the point of spending a whole weekend indoors; I am usually looking for some kind of
                adventure!</p>
